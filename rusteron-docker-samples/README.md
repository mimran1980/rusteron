# Dummy Example for Docker and Kubernetes Configuration

This repository contains a simple dummy example demonstrating how your Docker and Kubernetes configuration might look. It is not intended as a best-practice guide but rather as a source of inspiration if you're stuck and need a starting point.

## Overview

The example consists of:
1. **Aeron Media Driver**: A container running the Aeron media driver.
2. **Ticker Writer**: A dummy application acting as a writer.
3. **Ticker Reader**: A dummy application acting as a reader.

The setup uses:
- **Docker** for building container images.
- **Kubernetes** for deploying and running the containers with shared resources.

## Requirements

To run this example, you need:
- **Docker Desktop** with Kubernetes enabled.  
  Make sure Kubernetes is enabled under Docker Desktop settings.  
  Alternatively, any Kubernetes cluster can be used if appropriately configured.
- `kubectl` command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.

## Quick Start

### Build Docker Images

Run the following command to build the necessary Docker images:
```bash
just build
```

This command will:
1. Build the `aeron-media-driver` Docker image.
2. Build the `rusteron-dummy-example` Docker image.

### Deploy to Kubernetes

Deploy the pod configuration using:
```bash
just deploy
```

This command applies the `pod.yml` to your Kubernetes cluster. Ensure Kubernetes is running and accessible before deploying.

### Verify Deployment

Check the status of the pod:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Clean Up

To remove the pod, use:
```bash
kubectl delete pod dummy-example
```

## About This Example

This setup is a **simple dummy configuration**. It demonstrates:
- Using shared memory (`/dev/shm`) and shared data (`/data`) volumes across containers.
- Example `args` for defining specific entry points for the writer and reader.
- Kubernetes `pod.yml` for deploying multiple containers in a single pod.

This is not a production-ready setup but may serve as inspiration for structuring your Docker and Kubernetes configurations.

## Notes

- If using Docker Desktop, ensure Kubernetes is enabled under **Settings > Kubernetes**.
- The `just` tool is used for simplifying repetitive tasks. Install `just` from [its GitHub page](https://github.com/casey/just) if you don't already have it.
